<strong>culegooner</strong> - Their tutorial on ASM taught me how to replace class files from vanilla Minecraft and other mods using ASM. (https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/mapping-and-modding-tutorials/1571568-tutorial-1-6-2-changing-vanilla-without-editing). Additionally, some of the source code for their mod "Creeper Burn Core" was used to implement ASM methods in this mod (the link to the Creeper Burn Core source code can be found below).
